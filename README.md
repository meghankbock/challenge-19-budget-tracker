# challenge-19-budget-tracker

## Summary
This repository contains the frontend and backend code for the Budget Tracker Application. This application utilizes Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, and various elements of Progressive Web Applications, including Service Workers, IndexedDB, and a manifest. Users of this application can track their budget by creating new transactions and selecting to add or subtract these from their overall budget. These transactions are logged in a table as well as represented in a graph. Additionally, this app is able to provide a more seamless user experience with the help of Service Workers and IndexedDB. These tools cache client files as well as data so that when a user navigates away from the application or goes offline, all of their progress is automatically saved and retrieved. The live version of this application has been deployed to Heroku.
